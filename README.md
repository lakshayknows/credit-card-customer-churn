# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to predict customer churn in the credit card industry. Using historical customer data, the model identifies patterns and key factors influencing churn, aiding businesses in customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various customer attributes such as transaction history, account information, demographics, and credit card usage patterns. The target variable is whether a customer has churned or not.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding data distribution
   - Identifying correlations
   - Visualizing key trends

3. **Deep Learning Model:**
   - Implementing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Architecture design, including input, hidden, and output layers
   - Model training and optimization

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC-AUC curve analysis

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Usage
1. Load the Jupyter Notebook: `credit-card-customer-churn-deep-learning.ipynb`
2. Execute the cells step by step.
3. Modify hyperparameters and observe model performance.

## Results
The trained model provides insights into customer churn behavior, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.
